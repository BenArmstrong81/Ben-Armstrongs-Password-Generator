  ## What I Learned
  We focused on JavaScript this week. 
  
  With a focus on Variables, Arays, Iterations, Function, Objects and Object Methods. We even tied it in to how to log these scripts into the GoogleChromes Console. 

  We also bult upon our HTML skills, pulling our knowledge of how the HTML is structured/scripted and where to look for elements to tie into our JavaScript.

  This week was a little overwhelming for me however I learnt that practice was key this week. And to use resources such as Google, YouTube and MDN Docs etc. to research and close any knowledge gaps.

  ## What Problems Did we Solve?
  Using JavaScript "............."

  Created a clear and concise Readme file.
